This is gospel for the fallen ones
        Locked away in permanent slumber
        Assembling their philosophies
        From pieces of broken memories
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
        Conspire against the odds
        But they haven't seen the best of us yet
        
        If you love me, let me go
        If you love me, let me go
        'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
        The fear of falling apart
        And truth be told, I never was yours
        The fear, the fear of falling apart
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        This is gospel for the vagabonds
        Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
        Confessing their apostasies
        Led away by imperfect impostors
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        This is the beat of my heart
        This is the beat of my heart
        
        Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
        And bury me alive
        'Cause I won't give up without a fight
        
        If you love me, let me go
        If you love me, let me go
        'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
        The fear of falling apart
        And truth be told, I never was yours
        The fear, the fear of falling apart
        
        The fear of falling apart
        The fear, the fear of falling apart
        
        This is the beat of my heart (the fear of falling apart)
        This is the beat of my heart
